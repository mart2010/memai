# Technical Specification

*Last verified against code: 2026-07-12*

Internal contracts: architecture, protocol, formats, data model, algorithms. Terms per
[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md); conventions per [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). File references anchor
each area to its implementation.

## Invariants

Cross-cutting hard rules. Violating any of these is always a defect; changing one is a
design discussion, never a patch.

- **INV-1 — Live/offline boundary.** The live conversation path may read the DB
  (session start, recall, lazy selection fetch) but writes only JSONL session logs. DB
  writes, embedding generation for storage, LLM extraction/synthesis, upserts, and
  brief generation happen only in the offline pipeline or the bundle installer.
- **INV-2 — Dependency rule.** `domain/` imports nothing external; `services/` imports
  domain only and defines all ports; `infrastructure/` implements ports. Inner layers
  never import from outer ones.
- **INV-3 — Single user.** One `User` row, one connection at a time, no auth. Design
  decisions may rely on this.
- **INV-4 — No barge-in.** The response plays to completion; the mic re-opens only on
  `speaking_end`.
- **INV-5 — Session logs are kept forever.** No rotation or cleanup logic anywhere.
- **INV-6 — Persona-state opacity.** `persona_state` is written only by the owning
  persona's assessment strategy (via `update_persona_state`; upserts structurally
  exclude the column) and read only by that persona's selection strategy.
  `AssistantPersona.settings` has the same opacity one level up. No generic code path
  branches on the contents of either.
- **INV-7 — Voices anchor.** Every `voices` map contains the `"default"` role, and its
  value is a single voice (never a `|` pool). Enforced by the entity.
- **INV-8 — Description/embedding co-update.** On any content change to a
  concept/procedure description (or episode summary), the embedding is recomputed in
  the same operation. Under consolidation gates neither changes (both kept verbatim).
- **INV-9 — Persona scope & cascade.** Concept/procedure similarity search during
  upsert is always scoped to the owning persona. `ON DELETE CASCADE` from personas to
  concepts/procedures is load-bearing (clean persona teardown), not an oversight.
- **INV-10 — Episodes are persona-independent and primary-language.** Episodes carry no
  persona scope or language field; summaries are always written in
  `User.primary_language`. Personas with an assessment strategy never produce episodes
  at all.
- **INV-11 — Insertion order is curriculum order.** Ascending SERIAL id (within a
  type) / `created_at` (across types) is the contract bundle install writes and tutor
  selection reads. Nothing may reorder or renumber installed content.
- **INV-12 — Content sources never claim knowledge.** Bundle items and enrichment
  proposals always enter at `UNSEEN`; only generic consolidation moves engagement.
- **INV-13 — Language of first introduction is fixed.** `Concept.language` /
  `Procedure.language` never changes on upsert; descriptions stay in that language.
- **INV-14 — Secondary languages switch explicitly only.** No implicit persona or
  language switching from detected speech language.
- **INV-15 — Episode provenance is fixed.** `origin_conversation_id` is NOT NULL and
  never reassigned; `happened_at` is the temporal anchor, not the conversation date.

## TR-0xx — Architecture & composition

- **TR-001** Monorepo of three independent uv-managed packages: `client/` (capture &
  playback), `server/` (pipeline + memory), `setup/` (install wizard). Each has its own
  venv; Python ≥ 3.13.
- **TR-002** Server layout (`server/src/memai_server/`): `domain/` (entities, value
  objects, events, domain protocols), `services/` (use cases + ports), `infrastructure/`
  (Postgres, Ollama/OpenRouter, STT/TTS/embedding, JSONL, bundle TOML, per-persona
  strategy packages e.g. `language_tutor/`). INV-2 governs imports.
- **TR-003** `server.py` is the composition root: loads config, builds all adapters
  once (single long-lived process), wires use cases per connection.
- **TR-004** Strategy registries (`SELECTION/ASSESSMENT/ENRICHMENT_STRATEGY_FACTORIES`)
  map strategy-set names (e.g. `"language_tutor"`) to factories. Bindings are resolved
  per connection (selection) / per offline run (assessment, enrichment) by scanning
  personas' `strategy` fields — a bundle installed between sessions binds without a
  server restart. Unknown names log a warning and bind nothing.
- **TR-005** One registry entry serves every persona of that class (any target
  language); everything persona-specific comes from the persona's rows and `settings`,
  never from strategy code.
- **TR-006** Two independent Postgres connections: `conn` for the live path (event-loop
  thread), `offline_conn` for the background pipeline thread — a shared connection
  would interleave live queries into the offline transaction or block the loop.
- **TR-007** `ConsolidateMemory`, `EnrichMemory`, and replay are synchronous by design
  and must be dispatched via `asyncio.to_thread` when called from the event loop; brief
  generation streams async and is awaited directly.
- **TR-008** The one `User` row is bootstrapped by the server on startup when missing.

## TR-1xx — WebSocket protocol

`ws://localhost:<ws_port>` (default 8765), `max_size=None`.

| # | Message | Direction | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TR-101** | binary frame | client→server | PCM **int16** 16 kHz mono; accumulated in the utterance audio buffer (ignored until onboarding is done) |
| **TR-102** | `{"type": "end_utterance"}` | client→server | Flush the buffer to STT and run the turn; ignored when the buffer is empty or onboarding incomplete |
| **TR-103** | `{"type": "select_language", "supported": [codes]}` | server→client | Sent on connect iff `User.primary_language` is null |
| **TR-104** | `{"type": "language_selected", "language": code}` | client→server | Completes onboarding (FR-003); ignored once onboarding is done |
| **TR-105** | binary frame | server→client | PCM **float32** 16 kHz synthesised audio, one frame per synthesised segment |
| **TR-106** | `{"type": "speaking_end"}` | server→client | Sent after each turn's chunks (even when the turn produced nothing); re-enables client VAD |

- **TR-107** Unparseable text frames are ignored; unknown `type` values are ignored.
  (Forward-compatible: new message types must not break old peers.)

## TR-2xx — Client

`client/src/memai_client/client.py`; stateless beyond one config file.

- **TR-201** Config: `memai.toml` in the platform config dir
  (`platformdirs.user_config_dir("memai")`), `[server]` table: `ws_port` (default
  8765), optional `ssh_host`. Missing file → clear `FileNotFoundError` guidance.
- **TR-202** Capture: `sounddevice` InputStream, 16 kHz mono float32, blocksize 480
  (30 ms); each block converted to int16 (`×32768`) for VAD and the wire.
- **TR-203** VAD: `webrtcvad`, aggressiveness 2. Speech frames are sent immediately;
  silence frames are not sent.
- **TR-204** End-of-utterance: after speech has been active, **> 25 consecutive silent
  frames** (~750 ms) sends `end_utterance` and resets. Silence before any speech sends
  nothing.
- **TR-205** Mic muting: an event flag suppresses the VAD callback from the first
  received audio chunk until `speaking_end` (and while the onboarding prompt is open);
  playback is blocking (`sd.play` + wait) per chunk.
- **TR-206** SSH tunnel (split-host): `ssh -N -L {ws_port}:localhost:{ws_port}
  {ssh_host}` as a daemon-thread subprocess, restarted in a loop 3 s after exit. Proxy
  env vars (`HTTP(S)_PROXY`) are stripped from the process environment.
- **TR-207** Onboarding UI: `questionary.select` terminal dropdown over the
  `supported` codes; falls back to the first entry on cancel.

## TR-3xx — Server live turn pipeline

`services/session.py` (`StartSession`, `ProcessTurn`, `EndSession`).

- **TR-301** `StartSession` loads: `User`, GA persona, all personas, memory brief
  (skipped during onboarding), and the session tail — previous session's last
  `session_tail_turns` (10) turns iff it ended within
  `session_continuation_threshold_hours` (24). Fails fast when User or GA is missing.
- **TR-302** Turn sequence: STT → log user turn → recall detection (embed query,
  `search` top 5, persona-scoped) → lazy selection fetch/consume (TR-306) → compose
  working context → stream LLM → per-sentence TTS → resolve markers → log assistant
  turn → rolling-summary check.
- **TR-303** Working-context composition (`_compose_working_context`): system prompt =
  persona prompt ⊕ onboarding directives (first launch) ⊕ response-language
  instruction ⊕ memory brief ⊕ recalled memories ⊕ persona list (when > 1). Messages =
  session tail (as one system message) ⊕ rolling summary ⊕ recent turns; a selected
  item is injected as a system message immediately before the current user turn.
- **TR-304** Response prefix grammar, resolved incrementally from the token stream (a
  partial candidate holds tokens back; a non-match releases them as text):
  `[PERSONA:name]` then `[FOCUS: wish]` then `[TOPIC_CONTINUATION]|[TOPIC_BREAK]` — in
  that order, each optional, only at response start. `[TOPIC_CONTINUATION]` outside a
  session's first turn is swallowed (not spoken, no event). A stream ending mid-prefix
  is emitted as plain text.
- **TR-305** `[SPEAKER:role]` tags are parsed inline **after** the prefix, anywhere in
  the response: a role switch flushes the open segment with the outgoing voice, then
  switches. Unknown roles resolve to the default anchor; a dangling partial tag at
  stream end is plain text.
- **TR-306** Selection batches: fetched lazily on a strategy persona's first active
  turn (`select_items(persona_id)`, a live DB *read*), stored per persona id in working
  memory; one item popped per turn; exhausted batches are not re-fetched. A `[FOCUS:]`
  marker re-fetches with the wish verbatim, replacing the batch — applied **after** any
  persona switch in the same response, so combined markers steer the target persona.
- **TR-307** Voice resolution (`_session_voice`): `voices[role]` (fallback default);
  `|`-pools pick index `session_id.int % len(pool)` — deterministic per session, no
  state.
- **TR-308** Sentence-level synthesis: segments split on `.` `!` `?`; each segment is
  markdown/emoji-stripped and number-spelled (num2words for en/fr/es/it/pt only) before
  TTS; empty segments are skipped.
- **TR-309** Rolling summary: when `total_turn_count % 50 == 0`, the oldest 25 recent
  turns are LLM-summarised into (or merged with) `rolling_summary` and dropped from the
  window.
- **TR-310** Persona switch: `[PERSONA:name]` matched case-insensitively against
  `list_all()` names; match ≠ active persona → switch + `PersonaSwitched` event; the
  assistant turn is logged under the **new** persona id.
- **TR-311** Latency instrumentation: `[latency]` stdout lines for STT, first LLM
  token, first TTS chunk, total-to-first-audio, total turn, inter-turn gap.
- **TR-312** Turn timestamps: the user turn is stamped at `end_utterance` receipt; the
  assistant turn is stamped when the LLM stream finishes — the assistant→user delta is
  the stored response-latency proxy consumed by tutor assessment (TR-806).

## TR-4xx — Session logs & replay

`infrastructure/json_file.py`, `services/replay.py`.

- **TR-401** One JSONL file per session: `logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_<session_id>.jsonl`
  (date = first append, UTC).
- **TR-402** Turn line: `{"ts": iso, "speaker": "user"|"assistant", "content": str}` +
  optional `"language"` (user turns), `"marker"` (`"break"|"continuation"`), and
  `"persona_id"` (assistant turns). Close line: `{"type": "session_closed", "ts": iso,
  "clean_exit": bool}`.
- **TR-403** Replay grouping (`_group_into_conversations`): a `continuation` marker on
  the session's first assistant turn → the whole session extends the last open
  conversation in the DB (when none exists, it is saved as new); a `break` marker on a
  later assistant turn closes the current group (inclusive) and starts a new one; a
  `break` on the first assistant turn is ignored (a new session is already a boundary).
  Each group's persona is the persona of its first assistant turn (default GA).
- **TR-404** A file without `session_closed` (crash) is still replayed; the group's
  `ended_at` falls back to its last turn timestamp.
- **TR-405** Replay idempotency: files are scanned newest-first and the scan stops at
  the first session already persisted (monotonic invariant — older files are
  necessarily persisted); unprocessed sessions are then replayed oldest-first.
- **TR-406** Replay runs on every client connect (before the session starts) and as
  step 1 of the offline pipeline.

## TR-5xx — Data model & schema

`server/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`, `domain/model.py`.

- **TR-501** PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector; all embeddings `vector(1024)`
  (`multilingual-e5-large`); HNSW cosine indexes on episodes/concepts/procedures.
- **TR-502** Tables: `users` (singleton), `personas`, `conversations`, `turns`
  (composite PK conversation_id+timestamp; `session_id` indexed for replay
  idempotency), `episodes`, `concepts`, `procedures`, `bundle_installs` (append-only),
  `memory_brief` (singleton, `id = 1`).
- **TR-503** FKs: concepts/procedures → personas `ON DELETE CASCADE` (INV-9);
  conversations → personas `ON DELETE RESTRICT`; turns → conversations
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`; episodes → conversations (provenance, INV-15).
- **TR-504** `EngagementLevel` is an ordered enum `unseen(0) < mentioned(1) <
  explored(2) < integrated(3)`; stored lowercase text; extracted items default to
  `mentioned`.
- **TR-505** `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` = the faster-whisper ∩ Kokoro intersection,
  currently `en fr es it pt ja zh-cn` (7; `ko` dropped — no Kokoro Korean pipeline).
- **TR-506** GA seed: fixed UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, `is_system`,
  idempotent insert; `persona_key`/`strategy` are set at creation only and never
  updated by `save()` (like `is_system`).
- **TR-507** `Conversation` aggregate rules: no turns after `ended_at`; consolidation
  requires ended + non-empty + not already consolidated (`mark_consolidated` enforces).
- **TR-508** `list_items` orders by ascending id within each memory type
  (curriculum-order read side, INV-11) and rejects episode queries; `list_all()`
  returns **all** personas, including deactivated ones. *(Note: the live persona list
  and `[PERSONA:]` matching therefore include deactivated personas — accepted for now;
  revisit when lifecycle gets a live trigger, FR-204.)*
- **TR-509** `search` returns `(similarity, item)` with **similarity = 1 − pgvector
  cosine distance**, merged across requested types, sorted, truncated to `top_n`;
  `persona_id` filters concepts/procedures only (episodes are global).

## TR-6xx — Upsert pipeline

`services/upsert.py` (`MemoryUpserter`) — the single shared merge-or-insert path for
consolidation, enrichment, and bundle install.

- **TR-601** Pipeline: embed (`"{name}: {description}"`; episodes embed the summary) →
  similarity search (concepts/procedures: top 5 persona-scoped; episodes: top 1
  global) → threshold decision → merge or insert.
- **TR-602** Two-tier thresholds: similarity ≥ `merge_threshold` (default 0.93) →
  auto-merge; ≥ `disambiguate_threshold` (default 0.75) → LLM binary disambiguation;
  below → insert. Configured via `[memory]` in `memai.toml`; defaults are calibration
  placeholders.
- **TR-603** Merge behaviour: LLM synthesis replaces the description (and steps),
  embedding recomputed (INV-8); engagement = max (FR-305); existing `category` wins,
  new one only fills a gap; item id adopted from the existing row.
- **TR-604** Exact-duplicate short-circuit: identical name + description (+ steps)
  skips synthesis and re-embedding — the reinstall fast path.
- **TR-605** `exclude_ids` (concepts/procedures): candidates with these ids are
  filtered out before the threshold decision — the bundle installer passes its own
  same-run insertions (sibling exclusion, FR-604). Top-5 candidate fetch exists so an
  excluded sibling cannot hide a real pre-existing match. Default empty; live
  consolidation never passes it.
- **TR-606** Consolidation gates: `allow_insert=False` → a miss returns without
  writing, `item.id` stays `None` as the *discarded sentinel* (callers must check
  before further use); `update_description=False` → a match keeps description, steps,
  and embedding verbatim (only engagement/category move). `ConsolidateMemory` sets
  both to `strategy is None` per conversation.
- **TR-607** Each `upsert_*` mutates the passed item in place and returns `True` on
  merge, `False` on insert-or-discard (disambiguated by the id sentinel).
- **TR-608** Episode merge synthesises the two summaries and re-embeds;
  `origin_conversation_id` is never reassigned (INV-15).

## TR-7xx — Offline pipeline

`services/memory.py`, `server.py`.

- **TR-701** Trigger: on disconnect, an idle task sleeps
  `idle_consolidation_minutes × 60` then runs the pipeline; a new connection cancels
  the pending task. Pipeline exceptions are logged, never fatal.
- **TR-702** Order: replay (TR-406) → `ConsolidateMemory` → `EnrichMemory` →
  `GenerateMemoryBrief` (only when ≥ 1 conversation was consolidated). All against the
  offline connection (TR-006).
- **TR-703** Per conversation, one transaction wraps: worthiness evaluation →
  extraction (`extract_episodes = allow_insert`, INV-10) → episode upserts (worthy
  only, FR-307) → concept/procedure upserts (gated, TR-606) → assessment dispatch →
  `mark_consolidated`. Any raise rolls the whole conversation back for full
  reprocessing (FR-405).
- **TR-704** Assessment dispatch: after upserts, `assess_items(persona_id,
  conversation, touched)` where `touched` = items that hold an id (discarded misses
  excluded); returned `ItemAssessment.persona_state` dicts are persisted byte-for-byte
  via `update_persona_state` (INV-6).
- **TR-705** Enrichment: per persona with a strategy, `propose_items` drafts are forced
  to `UNSEEN` (INV-12) and upserted (ungated) in one transaction per persona batch.
- **TR-706** Extraction language rule: the extractor receives
  `User.primary_language` and must write episode summaries in it (INV-10);
  `extract_episodes=False` omits the episode request from the prompt entirely.

## TR-8xx — Language-tutor strategies

`infrastructure/language_tutor/` — reference implementation of the three ports.

- **TR-801** All tutor tunables live in `AssistantPersona.settings` (opaque, INV-6)
  with in-code defaults marked as calibration placeholders:
  `ranking` (`"engagement"`* | `"retention"`), `batch_review_share` (0.5),
  `episode_anchor_threshold` (0.6), `elicitation_cap` (2),
  `initial_half_life_days` (1.0), `half_life_growth` (2.0), `half_life_shrink` (0.5),
  `user_initiated_boost` (2.0), `pair_difficulty` (map keyed by learner language,
  `"*"` fallback), `interest_cluster_threshold` (0.55), `interest_cluster_min_size`
  (3), `enrichment_batch_size` (5).
- **TR-802** Selection pools: new = `UNSEEN` items in curriculum order (`created_at`,
  id); review = engagement > `UNSEEN`, ranked least-known-then-stalest (engagement
  mode) or ascending retention `2^(−days/half_life)` with missing/invalid SRS state
  most due (retention mode).
- **TR-803** Batch composition: focus topic → similarity-ranked over the mode's pool;
  focus mode review/new → that pool; default mixed → `review_share` of the limit from
  review, rest new, each backfilling the other. Then category interleave (round-robin,
  first-appearance order, stable within category). Focus category filters items but
  falls back to all when it would empty the session.
- **TR-804** Focus interpretation: the verbatim wish + the persona's actually-present
  category values go to a `FocusInterpreter` LLM returning `TutorFocus(mode, category,
  topic)` — the interpreter can only target real taxonomy values.
- **TR-805** Episode pairing: per batch item, top-1 episode similarity ≥ threshold →
  anchor context with the episode summary; otherwise an elicitation hint, at most
  `elicitation_cap` per batch (FR-503).
- **TR-806** Assessment: per touched item, an LLM `PracticeJudge` yields
  `(retrievals, errors, user_initiated)` matched back by name (no judgment = exposure
  only, which still moves the day anchor); current stored `persona_state` is re-read
  from the repository (upsert output never carries it); conversation-mean
  assistant→user latency (TR-312) is folded in weighted low. Half-life: grows
  `×growth` on successful retrieval, shrinks `×shrink` on error, floor 0.5 days,
  initial value boosted for user-initiated items and scaled by pair difficulty;
  `last_practiced_at` is the conversation's date (day granularity).
- **TR-807** Enrichment: seeds = user-initiated concepts (flag from SRS state) with
  embeddings; greedy single-pass cosine clustering at `interest_cluster_threshold`;
  qualifying clusters need `min_size`; **one cluster per run** (largest); cluster
  language = majority vote; the `ClusterProposer` LLM returns up to
  `enrichment_batch_size` drafts.
- **TR-808** The tutor's SRS `persona_state` vocabulary is exactly the `state.py`
  constants (glossary: *SRS state*); mastery/next-due are always derived, never stored.

## TR-9xx — Persona bundle format

`infrastructure/bundle_toml.py`, `services/bundle_install.py`, `bundle_cli.py`. The
format **is** the port (version `BUNDLE_FORMAT_VERSION = 1`); parse-and-reject is the
only validation layer.

- **TR-901** A bundle is a directory: `bundle.toml` manifest + `lessons/*.toml`
  (≥ 1 required), lessons ordered by filename sort.
- **TR-902** Manifest: `format_version` (must equal 1), `persona_key` (non-empty
  string), `[bundle]` table with required `name`, `version`, `author` (+ optional
  `description`), optional `[provenance]`; `[bundle]`+`[provenance]` are persisted
  verbatim to the install log (TR-905).
- **TR-903** Optional `[persona]` table: `name`, `system_prompt`, `languages`,
  `response_language`, `voices` (may omit `default` — derived from
  `User.primary_language` via the composition root's language→voice map), optional
  `settings` (copied verbatim) and `strategy`. Unknown keys are rejected.
- **TR-904** Install algorithm: resolve persona by `persona_key` (create from
  `[persona]` when absent — requires completed onboarding; error when neither exists;
  existing persona + `[persona]` → notice, definition ignored). Persona `languages` =
  bundle list + primary language appended iff absent. Then per lesson, one transaction;
  per item, upsert as `UNSEEN` with same-run sibling exclusion (separate id sets per
  memory type). A failed run is recovered by re-running (committed lessons merge via
  TR-604).
- **TR-905** Install log: one `bundle_installs` row per run — persona_key (plain text,
  survives persona deletion), bundle identity, timestamps, inserted/merged counts,
  manifest verbatim. Read by nothing; not a reinstall guard.
- **TR-906** `memai-bundle install <path>` runs as its own process (own DB connection,
  embedding model, config); documented caveat: run while the server is idle (a
  concurrent consolidation could race the same persona's upserts — documentation, not
  locking, per INV-3).

## TR-95x — Configuration & models

- **TR-951** Server config `memai.toml` (platform config dir; wizard-generated):
  `[server] ws_port=8765, log_dir="logs/sessions"`; `[database] url` (libpq DSN; peer
  auth default on Linux/macOS); `[stt] model_path, device cuda|cpu, compute_type`
  (float16↔cuda, int8↔cpu); `[tts] device` (absent → Kokoro auto-detect); `[llm]
  model="aya-expanse", ollama_host?`; `[memory] merge_threshold=0.93,
  disambiguate_threshold=0.75`. Bootstrap-before-DB settings only (FR-701).
- **TR-952** Models: STT `faster-whisper` (beam 5, auto language); LLM via Ollama
  streaming (avoid ~70B-class models — VRAM eviction/cold-reload; avoid
  reasoning models — `<think>` blocks get spoken); TTS Kokoro (one lazily-created
  pipeline per voice-prefix language, output resampled 24 kHz → 16 kHz float32);
  embeddings `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` (1024-dim).
- **TR-953** LLM-backed judgment adapters (recall intent, worthiness, disambiguation,
  synthesis, extraction, tutor focus/judge/cluster) all use the same configured
  model/host as the conversational LLM. OpenRouter twins of the LLM adapters exist in
  `infrastructure/llm/openrouter.py` but are not wired into the composition root
  (deployment-alternative groundwork).
- **TR-954** Outbound TLS uses the OS trust store (`truststore`) — corporate-proxy
  resilience for any adapter that still touches the network.
